### ECO Twitch Whitelist

This server plugin allows your whitelist to be limited to your twitch subs.

 You can use a service like https://whitelist.gorymoon.se to allow subscribers
 to whitelist themself with their SteamID to be used in the plugin.
 
 ## Setup
Get one or more newline-separated link/links and add them to the config, 
either the graphical one or in the `TwitchWhitelist.eco` config file.
 
You can add additional whitelists in the config as the main ECO whitelist is 
overridden when the mod is syncing the list.
